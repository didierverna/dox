* Description
=============

The doc package provides LaTeX developers with means to describe the usage and
the definition of new commands and environments. However, there is no simple
way to extend this functionality to other items (options or counters for
instance). DoX is designed to circumvent this limitation, and provides some
improvements over the existing functionality as well.

* Installation
==============

If you are building DoX from the tarball you need to execute the following
steps in order to extract the necessary files: 

[pdf]latex dox.ins 
[pdf]latex dox.dtx 
[pdf]latex dox.dtx 

After that, you need to install the generated documentation and style files to
a location where LaTeX can find them. For a TDS-compliant layout, the
following locations are suggested:

[TEXMF]/tex/latex/dox/dox.sty 
[TEXMF]/doc/latex/dox/dox.[pdf|dvi] 

If you're an AUC-TeX user, you can also install the file `dox.el' in a
suitable AUC-TeX style directory.


	Have fun!
