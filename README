DoX consists of the following files:

- README (this file)
- NEWS
- dox.ins
- dox.dtx
- dox.el


* Description
=============

The doc package provides LaTeX developers with means to describe the usage and
the definition of new macros and environments. However, there is no simple way
to extend this functionality to other items (options or counters for
instance). The DoX package is designed to circumvent this limitation. DoX also
comes with support for AUC-TeX.


* Installation
==============

	To install the package, please follow these steps:

- Run LaTeX on the file `dox.ins' to create the style file `dox.sty'.
- Run LaTeX on the file `dox.dtx' to create the documentation.
- Install these files anywhere you see fit.

	If you're an AUC-TeX user, you can also install the file `dox.el' in
a suitable AUC-TeX style directory.

	Have fun!
